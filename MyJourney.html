        <p>For me Web Development was not at all part of my life. I didn't even know its an option that existed. I just
            knew that CODING IS BORING! So how did it become a thing that i love to do now you may ask?
            So during the time of lockdown i did some research and came across some people who were saying in todays
            world how skills are gonna be overtaking degrees. I mean thats a discusion for another time but i did agreed
            with them on some level.
            After my research i learned photoshop for 2 months and then thought of switching to web development
            because 'they say' one can earn a fortune in the field of programming, yes thats right, money was the
            primary motivation for me to learn programming.
        </p>

        <p>I Started by leaning HTML,CSS made a couple of web pages. After a having a good grip on HTML and CSS i
            started learning Javascript which i felt fairly tough at first. Then onwards i started creating simple
            application/games. It took a hell lot of a time for me to make each of them, it was getting frustrating at
            times but when the final product gets ready it feels total worth it. Thats when i realized i love creating
            and designing stuff, making things work is what i love to do. To improve my logical thinking i started doing
            problem solving exercises. Ofcouse none of them were easy, I've beaten my head over many times if i cant get
            it right, I've cried if anything doesnt seem to work, I've dropped many projects if i didnt know what should
            i use to work it out or i was too lazy complete it. I still do all of these things but one thing i've
            realized is i love failing and keep trying in this arena. I still have long long way to go and one day i
            want to be recognised as well established web developer.

            <strong> Here are some of my observations/learnings I've picked up on my journey so far..
                Just a disclaimer this may not apply to you because am still a beginner in this field.
            </strong>
        <ol>

            <li> You will have to give yourself some hard time.Its definitly not easy but its fun.</li>
            <li>If you dont know something, Google got your answers.</li>
            <li> Try to learn things you dont know in-depth. Dont just learn the top layer, dig a little deeper.</li>
            <li> Be Clam and Have patience. In stress you sometimes overlook the picture and miss the silly mistake you
                might have made.
            </li>

            <li> You wont learn by watching, you learn by actually coding.</li>
            <li> Whenever you are not coding do something fun and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Join communities with people better tham you, ask help and doubts if feel stuck.</li>
            <li> 1 hour daily practice is better than 5 hours in every 3 three days </li>
            <li> Dont be insecure if someone is better, be inspired.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>My perception that coding is boring has completely changed. In my opinion its only boring if you make it
            boring. If you set a goal of making an app/game, you'll love the process that's what's important.
